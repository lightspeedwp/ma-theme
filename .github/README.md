## Getting Started

Advanced documentation on the theme generation is provided [here](../docs/GENERATE_THEME.md)

### Visual Studio Code

This tool is meant to be used on its own, and not inside a WordPress install. We suggest creating a "tools" folder at the root of your hosting applications folder (where all the sites are housed).
You can then clone your it to your tools folder, and re-use it everytime you need a new theme.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (check .nvmrc for the required version)
- Composer (for PHP dependencies)
- A WordPress environment with a database.

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lightspeedwp/block-theme-scaffold.git
cd block-theme-scaffold
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Install PHP/Composer dependencies
composer install
```

#### 3. Generate your theme

**Interactive prompts (easiest)**

Add the folder to the chat to your IDE, and select the "Generate Theme Agent" from the agent dropdown, 

Then simply ask the agent to generate a theme, it will prompt you for the basic placeholder replacements.

```bash
Please generate a theme for me
```

If you cannot see it in the dropdown, add the js file to the chat as well.
Agent Location: `scripts/agents/generate-theme.agent.js`

```bash
Please use the attached agent and folder, and generate a theme for me.
```



**CLI Mode**
```bash
node scripts/generate-theme.js --slug my-theme --name "My Theme" --author  "Your Name" ...
```

**JSON Mode**
```bash
node scripts/generate-theme.js --config theme-config.json
```

#### 4. Copy the theme to your site.
Copy the `output-theme` directory that will be generated in your repository and copy and paste that in your `themes` directory. 

Make sure to rename it to the same value as your Theme Slug.
