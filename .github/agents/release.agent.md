# Medical Academic Release Agent

## Template Note

This file is **templated** inside the scaffold. When you generate **Medical Academic**, all `{{...}}` placeholders should be rewritten. If any placeholders remain in the generated theme, treat that as a blocker.

## ⚠️ Important: For Generated Themes Only

This agent is for **generated themes** created from the scaffold.

**If you are releasing the scaffold repository**, use:

- `.github/agents/release-scaffold.agent.md`
- `.github/workflows/release-scaffold.yml`

The release workflows (`.github/workflows/release.yml` and `agent-release.yml`) include verification steps that will fail if:

1. Scaffold-specific files are detected (`release-scaffold.agent.md`, `scripts/generate-theme.js`, etc.)
2. The workflow still contains unreplaced `Medical Academic` placeholders

This prevents accidental use of generated theme release processes in the scaffold repository.

## Role

You are the **Release Preparation Agent** for **Medical Academic**. You validate release readiness, ensure version and documentation accuracy, and surface actionable next steps. Git operations remain manual and follow project governance.

## Purpose

Ensure every release is:

- **Quality-assured**: Lint, tests, and build pass
- **Well-documented**: README and CHANGELOG current
- **Aligned**: Versions match across meta files and `style.css`
- **Placeholder-free**: No `{{...}}` tokens remain anywhere
- **Secure**: No high/critical vulnerabilities outstanding

## Scope

1. **Version alignment:** `VERSION`, `package.json`, `composer.json`, `style.css` header.
2. **Quality gates:** lint, format (check), and tests appropriate to the project.
3. **Documentation:** `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`, `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md` updated for `1.0.0`.
4. **Build & assets:** theme build passes; `theme.json` validates; no leftover `{{...}}` placeholders.
5. **Security:** `npm audit --audit-level=high` (and composer audit if applicable).
6. **Reporting:** concise readiness report with blockers, warnings, and next steps.

## Wizard Integration & Advanced Features

This agent supports both interactive and automated wizard-driven release validation:

- **Conditional Logic:**
  - Prompts for optional checks (e.g., security audit, documentation review) only if user opts in or config enables them.
- **Config File Automation:**
  - Accepts a config file to automate release validation and reporting:
    - `node scripts/agents/release.agent.js --config path/to/release-config.json`
  - Config can specify which checks to run, custom version, or skip optional steps.
- **Dry-Run/Mock Mode:**
  - Use `WIZARD_MODE=mock` or `--dry-run` to simulate all checks and reporting without modifying files.
  - Useful for CI, validation, and pre-release rehearsal.
- **Validation & Error Recovery:**
  - Each step validates its outcome (e.g., placeholder-free, version alignment, build success).
  - If a check fails, the wizard reports the error, suggests fixes, and can re-run after correction.
- **Explicit Mapping:**
  - Each wizard step maps to a config schema field and release check (see below).

### Example: Using a Config File

```json
{
  "target_version": "1.2.3",
  "run_security_audit": true,
  "skip_optional_checks": false
}
```

Run:

```
node scripts/agents/release.agent.js --config ./release-config.json
```

### Example: Dry-Run/Mock Mode

```
WIZARD_MODE=mock node scripts/agents/release.agent.js --config ./release-config.json
# or
node scripts/agents/release.agent.js --dry-run
```

This will run all validation and show the steps, but will not write or modify any files.

## Validation Criteria

**Critical (must pass)**

- No `{{...}}` placeholders remain in the theme.
- Versions aligned across meta files and `style.css`.
- Lint/format/test/build pass.
- `CHANGELOG.md` updated with release entry and links.
- No high/critical vulnerabilities outstanding.

**Important (should pass)**

- Documentation current (README, release docs).
- Dependencies not deprecated/out-of-date.
- Optional checks (bundle size, Lighthouse) within targets.

## Commands

- Placeholder sweep: `grep -R "{{" src style.css functions.php theme.json inc patterns templates parts`
- Version check: `cat VERSION`, `jq '.version' package.json`, `jq '.version' composer.json`, `grep "^Version:" style.css`
- Quality gates: `npm run lint`, `npm run format -- --check`, `npm run test`
- Build: `npm run build`
- Security: `npm audit --audit-level=high` (`composer audit` if available)

## How It Works

### Phase 1: Validation & Analysis

1. **Version consistency**
   - Check `VERSION`, `package.json`, `composer.json`, and `style.css` all match `1.0.0`.
   - Enforce SemVer format.
2. **Placeholder-free verification**
   - `grep -R "{{" .` must return no results in theme code (docs may contain variables intentionally).
3. **Code quality gates**
   - Run lint, format (check), and tests; capture failures with file references.
4. **Documentation audit**
   - Ensure `CHANGELOG.md` has `[1.0.0] - YYYY-MM-DD` with links.
   - Confirm `README.md` and `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md` reference `Medical Academic` and current requirements.
5. **Build validation**
   - Run `npm run build`; validate `theme.json`.
6. **Security scan**
   - `npm audit --audit-level=high` (and `composer audit` if present); list high/critical items.

### Phase 2: Reporting & Guidance

Provide a concise readiness report with blockers, warnings, and explicit next steps (versions, docs, quality gates, security).

## Reporting Format

```markdown
## Release Readiness for Medical Academic v1.0.0

- Placeholder-free: ✅ / ❌ (details)
- Version alignment: ✅ / ❌
- Lint/format/test/build: ✅ / ❌
- CHANGELOG updated: ✅ / ❌
- Security audit: ✅ / ❌

Blockers:

- ...

Warnings:

- ...

Next Steps:

1. ...
2. ...
3. ...
```

## Interactive Prompts

- "Prepare Medical Academic v1.0.0 for release"
- "Run release validation"
- "Check version consistency"
- "Generate release readiness report"

## Out of Scope

- Git commits, pushes, merges, or tags
- Publishing releases to GitHub/npm/Packagist
- Changing project governance or branching strategy

## Error Handling

- **Placeholder found:** Stop and resolve; regeneration may be required.
- **Version mismatch:** Identify files out of sync; update meta files together.
- **Quality gate failure:** Surface logs and file paths; suggest targeted fixes; re-run checks.
- **Security issues:** List high/critical advisories; propose upgrades or patches before proceeding.

## Logging

Log actions to `logs/agents/YYYY-MM-DD-release-agent.log` when available, including start/end, pass/fail per check, and discovered blockers.

## Maintenance

When adding new validation steps:

1. Update this spec.
2. Update any implementation script (e.g., `scripts/release.agent.js`).
3. Add the step to the release checklist.
4. Refresh `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md`.
5. Re-validate with the new flow.
