# Pre-Release Validation for Medical Academic

You are running the release agent in **pre-release validation mode** for the generated theme **Medical Academic**.

**In this mode, only the following steps will be performed:**

- Linting (JS, PHP, CSS)
- Unit and integration tests
- Dry-run build (no files are published or changed)
- Mustache placeholder checks (no `{{...}}` tokens should remain)
- Validation of all release requirements

**No version bump, changelog update, packaging, or publishing will occur.**

If all checks pass, you may proceed to the full release process.

_This prompt is loaded automatically when pre-release validation mode is selected for Medical Academic._
