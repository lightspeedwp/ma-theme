## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **PHP Naming Convention Standardization**: All theme functions and hooks now use `ma_theme` placeholder filter for consistent snake_case naming
  - Updated `functions.php` - theme setup, asset enqueue, and utility functions
  - Updated `inc/block-patterns.php` - pattern registration functions
  - Updated `inc/block-styles.php` - block style registration functions  
  - Updated `inc/template-functions.php` - template helper functions
  - All function names now follow WordPress coding standards (e.g., `my_theme_setup()` instead of `my-theme_setup()`)

- **Asset Handle Unification**: Standardized all asset handles to use `ma-theme` prefix
  - Style handles: `ma-theme-style`, `ma-theme-editor-style`
  - Script handles: `ma-theme-script`, `ma-theme-editor-script`
  - Image size names: `ma-theme-featured`, `ma-theme-thumbnail`, `ma-theme-gallery`

- **Theme Generator Improvements**: Enhanced placeholder replacement system in `scripts/generate-theme.js`
  - Added support for multiple filter types: `upper`, `snakeCase`, `phpCase`, `pascalCase`, `camelCase`
  - Consolidated placeholder replacement into single-pass regex for better performance
  - Improved error handling and validation for theme slug and author URI
  - Better error messages for invalid inputs
  - Protocol validation for author URIs (must start with http:// or https://)

- **theme.json Structure Updates**: Improved typography configuration
  - Font families now use proper object structure with `slug`, `fontFamily`, and `name` properties
  - Changed from array of strings to array of objects for better WordPress compatibility
  - Removed redundant top-level `color` setting

- **Test Suite Modernization**: Updated all PHPUnit tests to reflect new naming conventions
  - Updated test discovery to use `Test_` prefix in `phpunit.xml`
  - Fixed block style registry method calls to use `get_registered_styles_for_block()`
  - Updated theme.json version assertion from 2 to 3
  - Aligned test structure with WordPress coding standards

### Added

- **New Placeholder Variables**:
  - `250` - Logo width dimension (default: 250)
  - `100` - Logo height dimension (default: 100)
  - `40` - Excerpt length for archive/listing pages (default: 40)
  - `720` - Numeric content width without units

- **Schema Enhancements**: Added `archive_excerpt_length` configuration option
  - Type: integer, default: 40, range: 20-200
  - Controls excerpt length specifically for archive and listing pages

- **Documentation Improvements**: Enhanced `.github/README.md`
  - Clearer installation instructions
  - Multiple theme generation methods (Interactive, CLI, JSON)
  - Available scripts reference
  - Prerequisites section
  - Better structure and organization

### Fixed

- **Content Width Type Bug**: Fixed critical bug where `$GLOBALS['content_width']` was incorrectly set as string instead of integer
  - Changed from `'720px'` to `720`
  - Now properly passes integer value to WordPress for embed/media width calculations
  - Fixes PHPUnit test assertions for `assertIsInt($content_width)`

- **Placeholder Type Consistency**: Improved type handling in theme generator
  - Added string coercion for `content_width_num` calculation to prevent errors when config value is numeric
  - Better handling of missing or invalid placeholder values

- Automated mustache variable registry scan, update, and reporting:
  - Recursively scans all source, config, and documentation files for `{{mustache}}` variables.
  - Compares discovered variables to the canonical registry (`scripts/mustache-variables-registry.json`).
  - Auto-updates the registry to add new variables (with placeholder metadata), remove missing ones, and update changed entries.
  - Generates a dated validation report in `.github/reports/validation/` summarizing new, removed, updated, and unchanged variables.
  - Ensures all changes are tracked and reported for auditability and theme generation integrity.
  - Registry and report update is fully automated and non-interactive, supporting continuous validation workflows.
  - Husky pre-commit hooks and CI workflows now validate registry and report consistency before commit.

- Complete Phase 6 integration testing for logging and schema validation system
- Missing mustache variables: `year`, `excerpt_length`, `thumbnail_width`, `thumbnail_height`, `featured_image_width`, `featured_image_height`, `gallery_image_width`, `gallery_image_height`
- Support for mustache filter syntax (e.g., `MA_THEME`)
- **Dedicated scaffold release workflow** (`.github/workflows/release-scaffold.yml`) for validating scaffold releases
- **Schema validation step** in scaffold release process (`npm run test:schema`)
- **Phase 1 cleanup verification** in release workflows
- **Generation logging verification** in release workflows
- **Mustache placeholder checks** in generated theme release workflow
- **Workflow safeguards** preventing generated theme workflows from running in scaffold repository:
  - `release.yml` verifies no scaffold files exist and `Medical Academic` has been replaced
- **Organized agent script system**:
  - New `scripts/agents/` directory for all agent JavaScript implementations
  - `template.agent.js` - Template for creating new agent scripts
  - `template.agent.test.js` - Template for creating agent test suites

### Changed

- Changelog updated on 2025-12-19 to document recent improvements to mustache variable registry scan, update, and reporting, and to clarify validation/reporting workflow for continuous integration.

- Updated mustache variable registry and validation report as of 2025-12-18 scan:
  - Registry date updated to `2025-12-18T00:00:00Z`.
  - No new, missing, or changed variables detected in this scan; registry is current.
  - Validation report generated at `.github/reports/validation/2025-12-18-mustache-registry-scan.json`.
  - Improved documentation and traceability for mustache variable management.

- Documented script helper coverage improvements: `scripts/__tests__/jest.config.js` now anchors `<rootDir>` at the repo root, locks `roots` to the scripts tree, reuses CSS/file mocks from `tests/__mocks__`, routes coverage into `coverage/scripts`, and emits V8 reports that feed `coverage/scripts/lcov.info`.
- Generator now excludes `scripts/` and `logs/` directories from generated themes
- **Release process separation**: scaffold releases use `release-scaffold.agent.md` and `release-scaffold.yml`, generated themes use `release.agent.md` and `release.yml`
- **Enhanced scaffold release validation**: includes schema validation, generation smoke test, and Phase 1 cleanup verification
- **RELEASE_PROCESS.md now templated**: contains `{{mustache}}` placeholders for generated themes
- **RELEASE_PROCESS_SCAFFOLD.md updated**: includes schema validation and enhanced smoke test steps
- **Reorganized agent scripts**: all agent JavaScript files moved from `scripts/*.agent.js` to `scripts/agents/*.agent.js`
- **Updated all NPM script references** to use new `scripts/agents/` paths
- **Updated workflow references** in `.github/workflows/agent-*.yml` to use new paths
- **Generator Phase 1 cleanup** now includes `scripts/agents/release-scaffold.agent.js` in deletion list
- **Moved configuration files to logical locations**:
  - `dryrun-debug.log` moved to `logs/` (already ignored by .gitignore)
  - `theme-config.template.json` moved to `scripts/fixtures/`
  - Updated all references in documentation and scripts
  - Updated `.gitignore` to include all example JSON files in schemas

### Fixed

- Theme generation now properly replaces all mustache variables including date, content, and image size variables
- Generator no longer copies scaffold build scripts to generated themes, preventing syntax errors
- Mustache filter syntax `MA_THEME` now correctly transforms to uppercase with underscores (e.g., `MY_THEME_SLUG`)
